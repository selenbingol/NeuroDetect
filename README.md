# NeuroDetect
NeuroDetect is a decision-support system designed to analyse student performance and behavioural data in order to estimate cognitive risk levels at an early stage. The system focuses on learning-related indicators rather than clinical diagnosis and aims to support students, educators, and guardians through data-driven insights.

Project Purpose

The main objective of NeuroDetect is to:

Monitor student learning behaviour and performance

Identify potential cognitive risk trends early

Support timely academic intervention through analytics

NeuroDetect does not provide medical or psychological diagnoses. It functions solely as an educational decision-support tool.
